# code-refactor-homework
This homework project called for me to clean up and condense html and css code. These are the main tasks I performed.
1. Changing the names of generic html tags to semantic tags.
2. Condensing css classes to shorten the code. 
3. Adding alt elements to photos.
4. Checking links and fixing any broken links.
